## Introduction

Justification: My research program focuses on speech comprehension, in which considering temporal factors is essential. I am planning to work with degraded/noisy speech signals, adn one way to introduce noise is by adding multiple sound sources positioned in various locations. Considering this, learning more about spatial attention, as well as temporal attention, might provide me with useful insights. I was working on attention and auditory object recognition during my master's, and paradigms in the field were heavily influenced by the literature on visual object recognition. Therefore, I hope to find inspiration through this rescue project.

Required Stimuli & Procedures:"Two flashes of light were presented successively to the same location, and we determined the minimal interval between the flashes at which they were still perceived as two separate flashes, rather than as a single continuous flash. The shorter this critical interval is, the higher the temporal resolution. This measurement of temporal resolution was combined with a direct manipulation of transient spatial attention. In half the trials, the cued trials, a peripheral cue indicated the target’s onset and location. This exogenous cue, a small horizontal bar, allowed observers to focus their attention, in advance, on the target location, and was assumed to capture attention in a stimulus-driven, automatic manner. In the rest of the trials, the neutral trials, two long horizontal lines indicated the target’s onset but not its location (i.e., the target was equally likely to appear at any location)."

## Summary of prior replication attempt

Based on the prior write-up, describe any differences between the original and 1st replication in terms of methods, sample, sample size, and analysis. Note any potential problems such as exclusion rates, noisy data, or issues with analysis. 

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

How much power does your planned sample have for original effect? For an attenuated effect that is half the size of the original? 

(If power analysis is not possible or precise, discuss more fully how you determined a sample size that would be sufficient for rescue.)

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Controls

What attention checks, positive or negative controls, or other quality control measures are you adding so that a (positive or negative) result will be more interpretable?


### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study and 1st replication

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Results of control measures

How did people perform on any quality control checks or positive and negative controls? 

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Three-panel graph with original, 1st replication, and your replication is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

## Mini meta analysis
Combining across the original paper, 1st replication, and 2nd replication, what is the aggregate effect size? 

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
