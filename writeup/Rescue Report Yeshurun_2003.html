<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Justification: My research program focuses on speech comprehension, in which considering temporal factors is essential. I am planning to work with degraded/noisy speech signals, adn one way to introduce noise is by adding multiple sound sources positioned in various locations. Considering this, learning more about spatial attention, as well as temporal attention, might provide me with useful insights. I was working on attention and auditory object recognition during my master’s, and paradigms in the field were heavily influenced by the literature on visual object recognition. Therefore, I hope to find inspiration through this rescue project.</p>
<p>Required Stimuli &amp; Procedures:“Two flashes of light were presented successively to the same location, and we determined the minimal interval between the flashes at which they were still perceived as two separate flashes, rather than as a single continuous flash. The shorter this critical interval is, the higher the temporal resolution. This measurement of temporal resolution was combined with a direct manipulation of transient spatial attention. In half the trials, the cued trials, a peripheral cue indicated the target’s onset and location. This exogenous cue, a small horizontal bar, allowed observers to focus their attention, in advance, on the target location, and was assumed to capture attention in a stimulus-driven, automatic manner. In the rest of the trials, the neutral trials, two long horizontal lines indicated the target’s onset but not its location (i.e., the target was equally likely to appear at any location).” (Yeshurun &amp; Levy, 2003, p.226)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-prior-replication-attempt">Summary of prior replication attempt</h2>
<p>General summary of the prior replication attempt/original experient: As in the original study, each observer’s threshold of temporal resolution were measured in two different conditions (cued and neutral). In cued trials, a periphery cue were presented before the target onset, which indicates the target’s location. While in neutral trials, neutral cue with no indication of the target’s location were presented. The results from the original study was not replicated: * No main effect of cueing was observed in the prior replication attempt,unlike the original study. * The original study reported no interaction effect between cueing and ISI. Whereas, the first replication study found a significant interaction effect between cueing and ISI: In longer ISI conditions, spatial attention enhanced performance in the temporal resolution task, while in shorter ISI, spatial attention degraded the performance.</p>
<p>The original study had 18 participants while the 1st replication study had 10. The author of the 1st replication report notes that this was due to not being able to reach out to enough Psych1 students as they were collecting data in-person.This might be the reason behind not being able to replicate the original study. I aim to conduct the experiment online to be able to have the desired sample rate.</p>
<p>The original study did not report any exclusion from the sample. The 1st replication report states that no participant’s data was excluded from the study.</p>
<p>The original experiment and the 1st replication study have the same analysis methods.</p>

<p>The effect size is not reported in the original paper.The first replication study had 10 participants although it aimed to have 18 as in the original study. Therefore, I aim to get 18 participants following the number of participant reported in the original paper and see if I can replicate the findings.</p>

<p>Two-flash fusion threshold: Measure of temporal resolution. “Two flashes of light were presented successively to the same location, and we determined the minimal interval between the flashes at which they were still perceived as two separate flashes, rather than as a single continuous flash. The shorter this critical interval is, the higher the temporal resolution (e.g., Artieda, Pastor, Lacruz, &amp; Obeso, 1992;Reeves, 1996).”</p>
<p>Target: The target (37-cd/m2 disk with a diameter of 3 degrees) was composed of two flashes of light separated by a brief interval or a single continuous flash. “It appeared on a black background at one of 11 possible locations along the horizontal meridian, with eccentricity (distance from the center) ranging from 0 to 16.5 degrees. The cue in the cued trials was a 1 X 0.3 degrees green horizontal bar (43 cd/m2) appearing 0.5 degree above the target’s location. In the neutral trials, two 17 x 0.3 degree green horizontal lines appeared above and below the entire display.”</p>

<section id="procedure" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<p>I am planning to follow the exact procedure of the original study, used by the 1st replication attempt as well. Quoting from the original article:</p>
<p>“Each trial began with a fixation point followed by the attentional cue. The cue was present until the target’s offset, to prevent confusion between the flickering of the cue and that of the target. The target was presented 94 ms after onset of the cue: On 50% of the trials, two disks appeared, each for 47 ms, separated by a variable interval (inter stimulus interval, ISI, of 11–34 ms). On the rest of the trials, a single disk was presented for a duration ranging from 105 to 130 ms. These brief durations ensured that eye movements could not occur between cue onset and target offset (Mayfrank, Kimmig, &amp; Fischer,1987). Each observer viewed 864 trials presented in a randomized order. Both accuracy and reaction time (RT) were recorded.”</p>

<p>“Dependent Variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy(d’) was calculated following equation: d’ = z(hit) - z(false alarm), (Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 1991).</li>
<li>Criterion(c, measure of response bias) was calculated using: c = -0.5(z(hit) + z(false alarm)), (Macmillan &amp; Creelman, 1991).</li>

(changing varible names to more “intuitive” ones) - Compute accuracy (d prime) value based on the equation satated in the analysis plan section. - Calculate the mean d primes per subgroups for analysis and plotting. E.g. for cuing conditions (cued vs neural), eccentricity x cue, ISI x cue, eccentricity x ISI.</p>
